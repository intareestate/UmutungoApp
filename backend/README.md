# Umutungo Go Backend

This folder contains the standalone Go API and PostgreSQL data layer for Umutungo. The frontend can continue to evolve independently and call this API at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Run with Docker

From this folder:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

The API is available at `http://localhost:8080` and PostgreSQL at port `5432`. The API runs `migrations/001_init.sql` automatically on startup.

## Run locally

1. Start PostgreSQL and create a database named `umutungo`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and export the values in your shell.
3. Run:

```powershell
go mod tidy
go run ./cmd/server
```

The default development OTP is `111111`. It is returned only in development mode; production must connect an SMS provider before enabling real OTP delivery.

## Production follow-up

The schema and API are the backend foundation. Before production, add the selected SMS, MTN MoMo, Airtel Money, PSP, object storage/CDN, maps, push notification, CAPTCHA, and AI provider adapters. Move OTP/session secrets to a managed secret store, add rate limiting, and place the API behind TLS and an API gateway.
